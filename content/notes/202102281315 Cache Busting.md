# Cache busting

Most browsers (and applications) are optimised to cache static assets (images, CSS files, JavaScript, etc.) on a user's machine. This is a verified way to increase performance, however causes difficulties providing files when continuous deployment is a business requirement. For example exposing a file called `fragment.css` will no longer suffice as it will be cached on a user's machine, and updates to `fragment.css` will not reflect on that user's machine. In order to assert that a file gets cached, a technique called "cache busting" is used where a fingerprint is added to the end of the URL (E.g. `fragment.72.js`). Each subsequent deployment will add a new fingerprint.
