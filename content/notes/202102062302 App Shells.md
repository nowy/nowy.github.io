# App Shells

An app shell acts as a parent application for all micro frontends. It should not contain any business logic; instead the app shell has two main responsibilities: [[202102072253 Micro Frontends Asset Loading|loading code from different micro frontends]] and [[202102071240 Routing Using an App Shell|client-side routing]] between pages.

Other common features that appear in app shells include: 
- Authentication.
- Tracking managers and analytics.
- Performance monitoring.
- Error reporting.
