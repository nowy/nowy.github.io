# Notes Archive

I recently started a new way of memorizing the things I learn, which is essentially to write them in my own words as soon as I read them.

I follow the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method of taking notes. Take a peek at the notes I've kept and how they connect to each other.

My hope is that one day, eventually my zettelkasten will be big enough that it can be of use to other people. This is **still very bare**, I plan on adding to it as I read (and note down) more.

### How to use it

Easy. Click on the nodes on the right hand side. Colours represent their "tags", and the links recommend the next node. I plan on adding better visualisation in the future so hang on tight.

### Shout out

All reference you see right now are from Michael Geers' [Micro Frontends in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/micro-frontends-in-action), so thank you for being my first reference guide.
