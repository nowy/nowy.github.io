# Micro Frontend Composition

In practice different micro frontends are bound to appear on the same page. An example is when showing a header bar next to page content, or nested fragments. Composition  techniques can be grouped into [[202102042224 Server-side Composition|server-]] and [[202102042232 Client-side Composition|client-side]] composition.

These techniques help us understand how to compose micro frontends on either individually. A more common way of composing is by using [[202102071117 Universal Rendering|isomorphic applications / universal rendering too]].
