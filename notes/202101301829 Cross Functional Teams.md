# Cross Functional Teams

Cross functional teams are interdisciplinary teams formed of members with a common goal. They include members from different departments of organisations, and aim to solve for slow communication lines caused by specialized teams.

The main benefits are not only that features are faster to deliver due to the quick communication paths, but he user becomes the focus; as opposed to in specialised teams where the team's function is the focus. Adopting this strategy causes a small sacrifice for code quality, so adopting architectural patterns such as micro frontends can aid this.
