<h1>Server Markup Assembly Performance</h1><p>When composing markup on the server, a number of techniques can be used to mitigate for the effect of misbehaving fragments, which can cause performance or the user's experience to degrade.</p><h3>Loading fragments in parallel</h3><p>By loading all fragments in parallel, the loading time will only be as slow as time taken to load the slowest fragment, as opposed to a sum of all fragments.</p><h3>Avoiding nested fragments</h3><p>Nesting fragments can potentially increase response time as loading in parallel cannot be done for all fragments. Avoiding nested fragments can therefore mean faster response times.</p><h3>Deferring loading to client-side</h3><p>This technique is used to deffer specific fragments to load on the client-side instead of the server. This means we leverage the server for essentials (E.g. what is in the user's viewport), and offload non-essentials to load after the user is able to see the page.</p><h3>Streaming responses</h3><p>This is the concept of sending parts of the response at a time, as they are resolved. Doing so means the first transfer to the browser is made as soon as the first part is resolved, making the Time-to-first-byte very fast for the user.</p><h2>Links</h2><ul><li>[[202102042224 Server-side Composition]]</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li>[[Micro Frontends in Action]] (pages 69-81)</li></ul>
