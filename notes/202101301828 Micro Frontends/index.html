<h1>Micro Frontends</h1><p>Micro frontends are an architectural approach to building user interfaces where applications are split into vertical slices (small domain-driven sections of an application); removing the need for a centralised front end team, and instead favouring small cross functional teams.</p><p>Multiple codebases mean fewer lines of code per application; reducing the impact of tightly coupled code and bugs. This making it easier for teams to ship code without needing to coordinate with other teams. Smaller codebases also cater for rapidly changing tech due to a smaller blast radius when upgrading dependencies - updating the framework on a monolithic app, for instance, would be far more challenging. Lastly the lack of large teams means small architectural decisions can be made on the fly instead of in large meetings.</p><p>Micro frontends are not a technical concept, they are an organisational, and architectural approach. There are three essential concepts that glue different teams using micro frontends: <strong>design system</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>shared knowledge</strong>.</p><h2>Links</h2><ul><li>[[202101301829 Cross Functional Teams]]</li><li>[[202102071208 Micro Frontend Architecture]]</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li>[[Micro Frontends in Action]] (pages 1-6)</li></ul>
