<h1>Cross Functional Teams</h1><p>Cross functional teams are interdisciplinary teams formed of members with a common goal. They include members from different departments of organisations, and aim to solve for slow communication lines caused by specialized teams.</p><p>The main benefits are not only that features are faster to deliver due to the quick communication paths, but he user becomes the focus; as opposed to in specialised teams where the team's function is the focus. Adopting this strategy causes a small sacrifice for code quality, so adopting architectural patterns such as micro frontends can aid this.</p><h2>Links</h2><ul><li>[[202101301828 Micro Frontends]]</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li>[[Micro Frontends in Action]] (page 7)</li></ul>
