# Universal Rendering

Universal rendering combines both client- and server-side rendering to leverage the advantages giving the user the quick load times of server-side composition, and the interactive app-feel of client-side composition.

Universal rendering requires micro frontends to be able to be rendered on both the server, and the client. This is difficult when using native elements such as iframes or Web components as these don't render on the server.
